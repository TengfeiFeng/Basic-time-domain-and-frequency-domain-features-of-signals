# Basic time-domain and frequency-domain features of signals

Add 16 time-domain features including 10 dimensional features and 6 dimensionless features: maximum, minimum, range, mean, media, mode, standard deviation, root mean square(rms), mean square(ms), k-order moment and skewness, kurtosis, kurtosis factor, waveform factor, pulse factor, margin factor.The document is linked to the following blog link:[My blog](https://www.jianshu.com/p/3e83d91c3d8a) 

Add 10 frequency-domain features: fft_mean, fft_var, fft_entropy, fft_energy, fft_skew, fft_kurt, fft_shape_mean, fft_shape_std, fft_shape_skew, fft_kurt. The document is linked to the following blog link:[My blog](https://www.jianshu.com/p/f6516d5a71ed)
