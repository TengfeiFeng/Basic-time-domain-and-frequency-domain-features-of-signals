# Basic-time-domain-and-frequency-domain-features-of-signals

Up to now, only the code and documentation for extracting the basic time domain features of the signal have been uploaded. The document is linked to the following blog link:[My blog](https://www.jianshu.com/p/3e83d91c3d8a) 

Basic time domain features including ten dimensional features and six dimensionless features: maximum, minimum, range, mean, media, mode, standard deviation, root mean square(rms), mean square(ms), k-order moment and skewness, kurtosis, kurtosis factor, waveform factor, pulse factor, margin factor.
